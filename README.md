## Install ROS2
See: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Linux-Install-Debians/.
Note: Stop at "Install additional RMW implementationsÂ¶".

## Clone, build and run this package
```sh
cd
mkdir ndt_ws/src -p
cd ndt_ws
colcon build
./install/lib/ndt_matching/ndt_node
```

## Organization
The package contains an executable and a library. The library should contain
an implemented algorithm and the executable, a ROS2 node, should subscribe to two
PointCloud2 messages and publishes one PoseStamped message.

Two PointCloud2 messages will be played back by the rosbag2 tool and can be
together with the Pose message visualized in rviz2 tool.

Look for `TODO` placeholders in the ROS2 node and fill them in.
